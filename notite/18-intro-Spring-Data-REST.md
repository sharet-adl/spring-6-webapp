Spring Data REST
- creating RestFul APIs with just exposing spring-data repository
- Just define our entities and spring-data repositories =>
  => restfull controller created for us ..
- tool to expose DB/DB entities with just repositories


- Drawback: exposing the DB entities directly to API consumers !
